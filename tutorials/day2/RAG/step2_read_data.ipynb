identification of neurodegenerative diseases is crucial for effective diagnosis in neurological disorders.

In this study, we propose the use of Constant Q Cepstral Coefficients (CQCC), which leverage geometrically spaced frequency bins to provide superior spectrotemporal resolution, particularly for capturing \n","\n","...
