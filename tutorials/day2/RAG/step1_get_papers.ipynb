Major conferences like ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML use OpenReview to manage their submission and review process. It provides a public API to access papers, reviews, and metadata.\n","\n","Note: you can use your own pdfs and skip this notebook.\n","\n","## Overview of This Step\n","\n","In this notebook, we will:\n","1. Connect to the OpenReview API\n","2. Fetch papers from ICLR 2025 Conference\n","3. Download paper PDFs and metadata (title, abstract, authors)\n","4. Save the data for the next step in our RAG pipeline\n","\n","## Why This Matters for RAG\n","\n","A RAG pipeline needs a knowledge base. By collecting academic papers, we create a corpus of high-quality technical content that can be:\n","- Indexed and searched\n","- Used to answer questions about recent research\n","- Referenced with citations and proper attribution"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ab4dfe77","metadata":{"id":"ab4dfe77"},"source":["## Import Required
