This enables:\n","- **Semantic search**: Find content by meaning, not just keywords\n","- **Fast retrieval**: Approximate nearest neighbor search in milliseconds\n","- **Scalability**: Handle millions of documents efficiently\n","\n","## What is ChromaDB?\n","\n","[ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) is an open-source embedding database designed for AI applications. It features:\n","- **Easy to use**: Simple Python API\n","- **Persistent storage**: Data saved to disk\n","- **Built-in embeddings**: Or bring your own\n","- **Fast queries**: Optimized for similarity search\n","\n","## Overview of This Step\n","\n","In this notebook, we will:\n","1. Load markdown files from Step 2\n","2. Chunk documents into smaller, overlapping pieces\n","3. Generate embeddings using sentence-transformers\n","4. Store embeddings in ChromaDB with metadata\n","5. Test the search functionality\n","\n","## Why This Matters for RAG\n","\n","Vector databases are the foundation of RAG systems:\n","- **Retrieval**: Find relevant context for user queries\n","- **Context**: Provide LLMs with specific, relevant information\n","- **Citations**: Track which papers chunks come from\n","- **Efficiency**: Search thousands of documents in milliseconds\n","\n","### The RAG Pipeline So Far\n","\n","1. **Step 1**: ✅ Collected papers from OpenReview\n","2. **Step 2**: ✅ Converted PDFs to structured Markdown\n","3. **Step 3**: 🎯 **Build vector database** ← We are here\n","4. **Next Steps**: Query system and answer generation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6e800327","metadata":{"id":"6e800327"},"source":["## Import Required
